I'm a UNIX system administrator, currently employed by the 
[Network Startup Resource Center](https://nsrc.org).
I teach UNIX systems best practices in Africa and Asia. 

My current interests include wireless access networks, IoT, devops, and technology that simplifies
deployment, maintenance, and scalability -- including KVM/libvirt, LXD, Docker, CoreOS, and
Ganeti.
