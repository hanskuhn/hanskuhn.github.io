I'm a System Administrator, currently employed by the [Network Startup Resource Center](https://nsrc.org).
I teach UNIX systems best practices in Africa and Asia. 

My current interests include Wireless access networks, devops, and technology that simplifies
deployment, maintenance, and scalability -- including Vagrant, KVM/libvirt, Docker, CoreOS, and
Ganeti.
