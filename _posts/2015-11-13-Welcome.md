You never know when you'll want to do a sort, so let's start counting with zero. I might use this as a location 
for posting about my experiments with devops and cloud technologies. 

I've cribbed this website from the [jekyllnow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) github repo.
For now, I'll leave the defaults, but I'd like to get more familiar with jekyll as a blogging platform. 
I'm intrigued that it doesn't use a database backend which is a big barrier to deployment for many
web apps.
